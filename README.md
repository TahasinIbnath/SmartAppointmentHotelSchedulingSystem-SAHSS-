# SmartAppointmentHotelSchedulingSystem-SAHSS-
SAHSS is a web-based hotel booking system that allows clients to register, log in, and search for hotel rooms based on their preferences such as budget, room type, and location. The system recommends available rooms from a list of hotels and supports booking requests, which are approved by an admin and confirmed by hotel authorities.
